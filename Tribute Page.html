            <p id="title4">Rahat Fateh Ali Khan is a Pakistani singer, primarily of Qawwali, a devotional music of the Muslim Sufis. He is the nephew of the maestro of Qawwali, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and is well-known for his vocal belting techniques. He is also popularly known as "Shahenshah-e-Qawwali" (The King of Kings of Qawwali).
                He was born in Faisalabad, Pakistan in 1974, into a family of qawwals, traditional Sufi music singers. His father, Farrukh Fateh Ali Khan and his uncle, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, were the two most prominent qawwals of the 20th century. Khan was trained by his uncle, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and began performing publicly at the age of nine. At the age of sixteen, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan gave his first public performance at a concert in Karachi.
                In addition to qawwali, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan has also released album tracks in different genres of music, including pop, bhangra, ghazals, and Indi-pop. He has performed with international artists, such as Canadian singer Nelly Furtado and American rapper Jay-Z. He has also sung in numerous Bollywood films, including the Academy Award-winning soundtrack for the 2003 film Lagaan.
